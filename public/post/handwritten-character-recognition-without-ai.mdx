# Introduction

As an introduction, I should tell the backstory of this brief article.

As a starting point, I wanted to write an article about machine learning. It was nearly complete (and is still in progress).

But the illustration used in that work was a simple handwritten character recognition tool.

While satisfactory, it revealed a real example of a recurring issue:  
- Do you need machine learning for all of your problems?

Machine learning is a quick way to solve this problem, but it may be suboptimal.

And the final result is quite obscure. While you can grasp how the neural network is constructed, you are faced with an abysmal hole of  
knowledge when trying to understand what the neural network is actually doing.

In the end, the aim of this article is to implement a handwritten character recognition tool without machine learning, and to show that it is indeed possible.

This will be realized using the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithm, a popular method for comparing two time series.

It is quicker to implement, faster, and supports thousands of characters.

## ASAPP

We implemented the DTW algorithm in a second-year school project at the INSA Lyon engineering school.

My awesome team with whom I built the app was:
- [lylykin](https://github.com/lylykin) (my awesome girlfriend!)
- [lepoucebleu](https://github.com/LePouceBleu) (he is the reason why the project is filled with foxes)
- [DoubleD](https://github.com/DoubleD3269) (another great friend!)

The source code is available here: [lylykin/asapp](https://github.com/lylykin/asapp) (if you love the project, don't hesitate to leave a star ❤️!)

The application was designed to record online strokes and guess which Japanese character they corresponded to.

> What is Online vs Offline?
> - An **online** algorithm records raw stroke information, i.e., the position of the mouse cursor at a given time.  
>   Thus, it needs data in a time → point format, or index → point format. It is useful for data recorded in real time (e.g., a user writing on a screen).  
> - An **offline** algorithm processes raw pixels, for example. It is useful when converting photographic data into text.

We used an optimized DTW algorithm to speed up the process (since comparing over 1000 samples in near real time in Python is not trivial).

It was nearly impeccable, able to recognize complex characters easily. While slightly less effective with simple ones, it remained reliable.

The algorithm can be fine-tuned to improve recognition of simple characters with a reduced dataset.

# Stroke Comparison Algorithm: Possible Algorithms

In this article, we will assume you already have at hand:  
- The dataset as a list of strokes, each stroke being a list of points (already simplified)  
- The user input, as a list of strokes, each stroke being a list of points (already simplified)

To understand the DTW algorithm, we must first understand how a naïve implementation would work.

## Naïve Implementation

A first step could be to compare each recorded point in order. But in practice, this doesn't work because user strokes differ too much from the dataset.

Suppose you want to compare two strokes point-by-point in order:

<center>
<Image src="/pic/handwritten-without-ml/naive-ordered.svg" alt="Naïve handwritting comparison in order, showing offset in the strokes" width="550" height="554" />
</center>

We now have two problems:
- Some points can't be compared, and skipping them may reduce recognition quality.
- There's an offset in comparison; points are matched suboptimally.

After, you may swiftly try to implement an algorithm comparing each point with its closest neightbor:

<center>
<Image src="/pic/handwritten-without-ml/naive-distance.svg" alt="Naïve handwritting comparison by distance, showing a skipped point" width="550" height="554" />
</center>

While promising, this method can degrade quickly in quality, as some points may be skipped. Also, comparing A → B may not yield the same result as B → A.

To add insult to injury, distance comparison may lead to this:

<center>
<Image src="/pic/handwritten-without-ml/naive-distance-worse-case.svg" alt="Naïve handwritting comparison by distance, with a small line and a big line, the big line has one point being entirely skipped leading to bad comparison" width="550" height="554" />
</center>

Clearly, simplifying a line to a single point causes serious issues.

# The DTW Algorithm

We now have two requirements:
- Compare every point to another at least once
- Use a method that doesn’t depend on the number of points

The DTW algorithm solves both.

DTW (Dynamic Time Warping) will be explained in two parts: what it does, and how it is implemented.  
Note that it is tough to grasp DTW by code alone.

## What Does DTW Do?

DTW is complete when all points have been compared.

Initially, you have two indices, one for stroke A and one for stroke B, both starting at index 0.

<center>
<Image src="/pic/handwritten-without-ml/dtw-initial.svg" alt="The DTW initial step, comparing two strokes first point" width="550" height="554" />
</center>

Then you have three cases:
- Case 1: compare, then move only point A
- Case 2: compare, then move only point B
- Case 3: compare, then move both points

<center>
<Image src="/pic/handwritten-without-ml/dtw-comparison-select.svg" alt="The DTW comparison step, comparing two strokes points and having 3 cases" width="550" height="554" />
</center>

Each comparison adds a distance to the total weight. This process is repeated recursively until both indices reach the end.

The algorithm aims to produce the path with the smallest total weight, which becomes the "distance" between the two strokes.

```python
def dtw(strokeA, strokeB, indiceA, indiceB):
    dist = distance(strokeA[indiceA], strokeB[indiceB])  # add to total weight

    if indiceA == len(strokeA) and indiceB == len(strokeB):  # can't advance further
        return dist

    shortest_dist = math.inf

    # case 1: move only point A
    if indiceA < len(strokeA):
        shortest_dist = min(shortest_dist, dtw(strokeA, strokeB, indiceA + 1, indiceB))
    
    # case 2: move only point B
    if indiceB < len(strokeB):
        shortest_dist = min(shortest_dist, dtw(strokeA, strokeB, indiceA, indiceB + 1))
    
    # case 3: move both points
    if indiceA < len(strokeA) and indiceB < len(strokeB):
        shortest_dist = min(shortest_dist, dtw(strokeA, strokeB, indiceA + 1, indiceB + 1))

    return shortest_dist + dist
```

In the end, it may produce something like this: 

<center>
<Image src="/pic/handwritten-without-ml/dtw-comparison-final.svg" alt="The DTW final step, comparing two strokes" width="350" height="554" />
</center>

Here: every point are compared.

While this is *an approach* to implement the DTW, it is not excatly how it is correctly implemented.

First, in our case, we repeat a lot of information. For instance, if we have a same path at the end but only a small difference 
at the start, we recompute the point distance multiple time, which loose a lot of compute. 

To avoid doing a lot of unecessary comparison we must store each distance.



# DTW Matrix

To optimize, we store previously computed values in a matrix:

The DTW matrix is a 2D matrix that will store progressively the distance between each point of stroke A and stroke B.



<center>
<Image src="/pic/handwritten-without-ml/dtw-matrix.svg" alt="The DTW matrix before being filled" width="350" height="554" />
</center>

It will compute the accumulated distance for each point, then the last point will be the total distance between the two strokes.

> In theory, if you need the specific path taken to reach the last point, you need to reconstruct the path by going back from the last point to the first point.
> But as far as we are concerned, we only need the distance, so we will not reconstruct the path.

Firstly, we will start at the top left corner of the matrix, and progressively seek the shortest path to the bottom right corner of the matrix.

We construct the accumulated distance matrix by filling it progressively in reverse order. 
Meaning that for each couple of point (i, j) we will do: 

$
M[i, j] = \text{distance}(A[i], B[j]) + \min(M[i-1, j], M[i, j-1], M[i-1, j-1])
$


Meaning that for each point (i,j), we take the minimal path:
- case 1: either from the left, meaning only increasing the point in path B. 
- case 2: from the top meaning only increasing the point in path A 
- case 3: or from the top left, meaning increasing both point in path A and B 

<center>
<Image src="/pic/handwritten-without-ml/dtw-matrix-algo.svg" alt="The DTW matrix step of comparing two strokes" width="350" height="554" />
</center>

Ultimately, we add the euclidian distance between the two points A[i] and B[j] to the minimal path.

We can consider point being outside the matrix as having a distance of *infinity*. Or not compute them at all.

Let's recap: 
- The matrix is a way to compute the DTW recursivly by avoiding recomputing the same path multiple time 
- The matrix is constructed from the top left to the bottom right, and the last cell will hold the optimal path
- For each cell, we choose the optimal path like the old algorithm, and choose the lowest producing path 
    - we take 3 choice of either advancing only in the first stroke, 
    - either in the second one, 
    - or in both
- Take the next cell and repeat

Eventually, the matrix will generate a minimal path that will be the distance between the two strokes.
The path represents a set of comparisons between the two strokes, and the last cell will be the total distance.

As an example, let's have two different matrix paths for the same two strokes:

<center>
<Image src="/pic/handwritten-without-ml/dtw-matrix-algo-sample.svg" alt="The DTW matrix complete path when comparing two strokes, with two sample" width="350" height="554" />
</center>




It's the same algorithm as the recursive one, just being stored in a matrix and doing it in a wiser order. 

In code, it could be implement in this way: 
```python
def dtw_distance_matrix(pathA, pathB) -> (float):
    # fill the cost matrix with 0
    cost_matrix = [[0] * len(pathB) for _ in range(len(pathA))]
    
    # Initialize (0,0) with the distance 
    cost_matrix[0][0] = dist(pathA[0], pathB[0])
    
    # We can't go up, or up left as we are in the first row, so only consider path going left
    # First row (i = 0)
    for j in range(1, len(pathB)):
        cost_matrix[0][j] = cost_matrix[0][j-1] + dist(pathA[0], pathB[j])

    # We can't go left, or up left as we are in the first column, so only consider path going up
    # First column (j = 0)
    for i in range(1, len(pathA)):
        cost_matrix[i][0] = cost_matrix[i-1][0] + dist(pathA[i], pathB[0])

    # Populate the remainder of the matrix
    for i in range(1, len(pathA)):
        for j in range(1, len(pathB)):
            dist = dist(pathA[i], pathB[j])
            # note the format used is [Y,X]
            prev_min = min(
                cost_matrix[i-1][ j],    # CASE 2 
                cost_matrix[i][ j-1],    # CASE 1 
                cost_matrix[i-1][ j-1]   # CASE 3 
            )
            cost_matrix[i][ j] = dist + prev_min

    # The DTW distance is the bottom‑right element
    dtw_dist = cost_matrix[n-1][ m-1]
    return dtw_dist
```

Now you have a fully working DTW ! 


# DTW Optimizations 

You can further refine the DTW by avoiding statistically unprobable solution.

It has been found that the extreme path are generally not the best path, you can limit the search space by using a window.

As an illustration: 
<center>
<Image src="/pic/handwritten-without-ml/dtw-matrix-inefficient.svg" alt="The DTW matrix with two path: one being inefficient passing through the border, and one passing through the diagonal" width="450" height="554" />
</center>

To create a window, you can use the Sakoe-Chiba band, which is a band around the diagonal of the matrix. 
<center>
<Image src="/pic/handwritten-without-ml/dtw-matrix-window-shiba.svg" alt="The DTW matrix window, it is only allowing the diagonal band" width="450" height="554" />
</center>

Everytime we try to query a point outside the window, we can just ignore it and set the distance to infinity.

In code, it could be implemented like this: 


```python
def dtw_distance_matrix(pathA, pathB, window):
    n, m = len(pathA), len(pathB)
    cost_matrix = [[float('inf') for _ in range(len(pathB))] for _ in range(len(pathA))]

    cost_matrix[0][0] = dist(pathA[0], pathB[0])

    for j in range(1, len(pathB)):
        if window[0][j]:
            cost_matrix[0][j] = cost_matrix[0][j - 1] + dist(pathA[0], pathB[j])

    for i in range(1, len(pathA)):
        if window[i][0]:
            cost_matrix[i][0] = cost_matrix[i - 1][0] + dist(pathA[i], pathB[0])

    for i in range(1, len(pathA)):
        for j in range(1, len(pathB)):
            if window[i][j]:
                d = dist(pathA[i], pathB[j])
                prev_min = min(
                    cost_matrix[i - 1][j], # CASE 2 
                    cost_matrix[i][j - 1], # CASE 1
                    cost_matrix[i - 1][j - 1] # CASE 3
                )
                cost_matrix[i][j] = d + prev_min

    return cost_matrix[-1][-1]
```

Inside [ASAPP](https://github.com/lylykin/asapp/blob/main/dtw.py) we implemented the window creation like this: 


```python
def create_window(col, row, radius):
    if col <= 1 or row <= 1:
        return [[1 for _ in range(row)] for _ in range(col)]

    window = [[0 for _ in range(row)] for _ in range(col)]
    for i in range(col):
        for j in range(row):
            if abs(i * (row / col) - j) <= radius:
                window[i][j] = 1
    return window
```

The radius of a window is the width of the band. A higher radius means higher quality, but slower output, and vice-versa.

# Improving quality 

To further improve the DTW, you can use a better distance function. We were inspired by [this](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2018/2404089) paper to include more information in the distance function.

To do that, We included the direction of the stroke and the curvature. Then we used the following distance function: 


```python
def dist(val_1, val_2):
    return math.sqrt(
        (val_1.x - val_2.x) ** 2 +
        (val_1.y - val_2.y) ** 2 +
        (8 * delta_angle(val_1.theta, val_2.theta)) ** 2
    ) + (5 * (val_1.curvature - val_2.curvature)) ** 2
```

# Conclusion

This algorithm can always be improved and fine-tuned. It worked well in our case for complex Japanese kanji, though it required tuning to handle simple characters effectively. The Japanese dataset is a challenging one, but we succeeded.

I hope this helped you understand the Dynamic Time Warping algorithm.
